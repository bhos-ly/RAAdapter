These investments are commonly used when a business has a short-term excess of funds on which it wants to earn interest, but which will be needed to fund operations within the near future. These types of investments are usually very safe, but also have quite a low rate of return. Temporary investments are classified as current assets on the balance sheet.","category": "Current Asset","type": "TANGIBLE","risk": 3}, {"id": 9,"name": "Buildings","description": "Permanent or temporary structurer enclosed within exterior walls and a roof, and including all attached apparatus, equipment, and fixtures that cannot be removed without cutting into ceiling, floors, or walls.","type":"TANGIBLE", "category":"Fixed Assets", "risk":1}], "strategies" : [{"id": 1,"name": "OSINT","category": "","description": "Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) is the collection and analysis of information that is gathered from public, or open, sources.

The techniques defined by each pattern are used to convince a target into performing actions or divulging confidential information that benefit the adversary, often resulting in access to computer systems or facilities. While similar to a confidence trick or simple fraud, the term typically applies to trickery or deception for the purpose of information gathering, fraud, or computer system access. In most cases, the adversary never comes face-to-face with the victim.","category": "","type": "","vulnerability": 2},{"id": 5,"name": "Impersonification", "description": "Impersonation is one of several social engineering tools used to gain access to a system or network in order to commit fraud, industrial espionage or identity theft.

The goal of reverse engineering is often to duplicate the function, or a part of the function, of an object in order to duplicate or back engineer some aspect of its functioning. Reverse engineering techniques can be applied to mechanical objects, electronic devices, or software, although the methodology and techniques involved in each type of analysis differ widely.","category": "","type": "","vulnerability": 5},{"id": 16,"name": "Password Guessing","description": "In this attack, some asset (information, functionality, identity, etc.) is protected by a finite secret value. The attacker attempts to gain access to this asset by using trial-and-error to exhaustively explore all the possible secret values in the hope of finding the secret (or a value that is functionally equivalent) that will unlock the asset. Examples of secrets can include, but are not limited to, passwords, encryption keys, database lookup keys, and initial values to one-way functions.","category": "","type": "","vulnerability": 3}]}';
