This attack differs from resource depletion through leaks or allocations in that the latter attacks do not rely on the volume of requests made to the target but instead focus on manipulation of the target's operations. The key factor in a DOS/DDOS attack is the number of requests the adversary can make in a given period of time. The greater this number, the more likely an attack is to succeed against a given target.","frequency":"HIGH","skill":"MEDIUM","resources":"HIGH","likelihood":"MEDIUM","created":"2018-11-13T21:23:21.298536+01:00","modified":"2018-11-13T21:23:21.298536+01:00","mitigations":[{"id":17,"name":"ISP DOS Protection","description":"","created":"2018-11-13T21:23:21.486583+01:00","modified":"2018-11-13T21:23:21.486583+01:00"},{"id":2,"name":"IDS/IPS","description":"","created":"2018-11-13T21:23:21.486583+01:00","modified":"2018-11-13T21:23:21.486583+01:00"},{"id":3,"name":"Firewall/UTM","description":"","created":"2018-11-13T21:23:21.486583+01:00","modified":"2018-11-13T21:23:21.486583+01:00"}],"levels":[{"id":2,"name":"IT","description":"Waiting for description","container":{"id":2,"name":"IT","description":"description","containerType":"IT","created":"2018-11-13T21:23:21.227301+01:00"}}],"phases":[{"id":3,"name":"Delivery","description":"Transmission of the weapon to the targeted environment.
